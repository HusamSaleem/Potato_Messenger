# A messenger replica AKA "Potato Messenger" :)

# Why I created it
- A nice simplified replica of a chat system like Facebook's messenger. I created this to learn more about networking, MySQL, AWS and Android Studio so it isn't really meant for anything outside of personal use or just for fun. Almost 5k lines of code combined with the client side
